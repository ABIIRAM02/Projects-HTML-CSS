        <h3>FEW WORDS:</h3>
        <P> <span>l</span>ife is the journey of living. We live, we lead our lives and we die. In doing so, we try to give
            shape to our lives. Life is not the same for everyone. Some people face a lot of difficulty with life while some
            don’t. Those who do not face any difficulty in life look at it in one way. Those who suffer in life look at it
            in another way. Life is often said to be precious. That all the more is evident through the various ways in
            which people try to save lives.Life is one word that comes with multiple meanings and experiences. Above all
            life is not just
            about existence but also about how an individual defines that existence. Hence, it is important to look at life
            not just from one single perspective. Philosophers, scholars, poets and authors have written much about what
            constitutes living and more importantly what are the necessary items that define someone’s life. Ofcourse this
            exercise has been done in various ways. While philosophers would try to find the meaning and purpose behind the
            life of individuals, poets and authors would document the richness of life at various stages. Life is thus
            perhaps something that is more than intriguing.The world these days, governed by competition, makes survival the
            most difficult thing. And for those whose existence is challenging hope is the only way of survival. This is one
            way, life can be summed up in words. The fact however is, life cannot be summed up in words. Words fail to
            express the meaning and purpose that anyone feels he or she has in life. For some it might be to create or build
            something, for someone it might be gaining knowledge, for someone it might be to have fun.</P>

        <h2>ADVENTURE LIFE</h2>
        <p> Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,[2] which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or
            positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to
            adventurer André Malraux, in his La Condition Humaine (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is
            his dignity?
    
            Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."[3]
    
            Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples
            are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as
            those undertaken by explorers and pioneers  the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to
            draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share
            with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.</p>

        <p> <span>l</span>ife keeps throwing challenges at us, and when we do not give up on them, that's adventure too.
            Life starts with adventure of being born and ends with starting a new adventure no one knows after death.
    
            The major misconception in this world is that life for some is not adventurous and boring. But the fact is that
            life does not move constantly. It has its ups and downs. Change is the only constant. When one comes out of the
            comfort zone, when one changes one’s lifestyle for good, then is the time one truly realizes that life is indeed
            all about adventure.Life according to me is the greatest adventure because no examination, no training camp, not
            even the best of friends can challenge one the way life does. It makes us see bad days and when we are
            struggling to get out of the bad phase, we are in an adventurous phase.
    
            Another misconception with the word adventure is deliberately taking harmful risks. For instance, consuming
            drugs and alcoholism is not adventurous, it is risking the beautiful adventure called life. Life is very short
            and making it shorter is not exciting, it is silly. Suicides is not adventurous; it is giving in to the
            challenges life throws at one and losing out on the adventure, it is cowardice.
    
            In the end I would just like add, that Life is constantly changing, as change is the only constant. And life
            keeps surprising one and is unpredictable. So, one should always be ready to face life, ready to face yet
            another adventure; because life is not only all about adventure, life is adventure.</p>
